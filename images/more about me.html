                Volunteering has always been important to me. I actively participated in Pune Ploggers, a community dedicated to keeping our environment clean.
                During the Covid period when the healtcare workers were giving their best to protect us i thought of doing something for the community so i decided to join this group and be a part of cleaning the environment and keeping it clean.

                Music has always been a huge part of my life. I play the guitar and always you can find me playing it or listening to music in my off time, and I love experimenting with different styles, from rock and blues to Indian classical.
                Whether it's jamming with friends or composing my own pieces, music helps me express my creativity.
